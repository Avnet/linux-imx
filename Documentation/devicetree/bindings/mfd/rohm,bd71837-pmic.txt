* ROHM BD71837 and BD71847 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

BD71837MWV and BD71847MWV are programmable Power Management ICs for powering
single-core, dual-core, and quad-core SoCs such as NXP-i.MX 8M. They are
optimized for low BOM cost and compact solution footprint. BD71837MWV
integrates 8 Buck regulators and 7 LDOs. BD71847MWV contains 6 Buck regulators
and 6 LDOs.

Datasheet for BD71837 is available at:
https://www.rohm.com/datasheet/BD71837MWV/bd71837mwv-e

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "rohm,bd71837" for bd71837
				    "rohm,bd71847" for bd71847.
 - reg			: I2C slave address.
 - interrupt-parent	: Phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - clocks		: The parent clock connected to PMIC. If this is missing
			  32768 KHz clock is assumed.
 - #clock-cells		: Should be 0.
 - regulators:		: List of child nodes that specify the regulators.
			  Please see ../regulator/rohm,bd71837-regulator.txt

Optional properties:
 - clock-output-names		: Should contain name for output clock.
 - rohm,pmic-buck1-dvs-voltage	: Should contain list of voltage levels matching
				  HW states. First voltage is for RUN, second
				  for IDLE and third for SUSPEND. Voltages
				  should be given in uV.
 - rohm,pmic-buck2-dvs-voltage	: Like rohm,pmic-buck1-dvs-voltage but SUSPEND
				  state is not used. Only give voltages for RUN
				  and IDLE
 - rohm,pmic-buck3-dvs-voltage	: Like rohm,pmic-buck2-dvs-voltage but only for
				  RUN state. Not on BD71847.
 - rohm,pmic-buck4-dvs-voltage	: Like rohm,pmic-buck3-dvs-voltage.
				  Not on BD71847.
